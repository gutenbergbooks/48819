<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 18th June, 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">As you allow me the honour of your
correspondence, I may not omit acquainting
you with so remarkable an
event as the withdraw of the commissioners
of the customs and most of the other officers
under them from the town on board the
Romney, with an intent to remove from thence
to the castle.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 10th a sloop belonging
to Mr. Hancock, a representative for Boston,
and a wealthy merchant, of great influence over
the populace, was seized by the collector and
comptroller for a very notorious breach of the
acts of trade, and, after seizure taken into custody
by the officer of the Romney man of war,
and remov’d under command of her guns. It
is pretended that the removal and not the seizure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
incensed the people. It seems not very material
which it was&mdash;A mob was immediately
rais’d, the officers insulted, bruis’d and much
hurt, and the windows of some of their houses
broke; a boat belonging to the collector burnt
in triumph, and many threats utter’d against the
commissioners and their officers: no notice being
taken of their extravagance in the time of it,
nor any endeavours by any authority except the
governor, the next day to discover and punish
the offenders; and there being a rumour of a
higher mob intended Monday (the 13th) in the
evening the commissioners, <i>four of them</i>, thought
themselves altogether unsafe, being destitute of
protection, and remov’d with their families to the
Romney, and there remain and hold their board,
and next week intend to do the same, and also
open the custom-house at the castle. The governor
press’d the council to assist him with their
advice, but they declin’d and evaded calling it
a brush or small disturbance by boys and negroes,
not considering <i>how much it must be resented in
England</i> that the officers of the crown should
think themselves obliged to quit the place of
their residence and go on board a King’s ship for
safety, and all the internal authority of the province
take no notice of it&mdash;The town of Boston
have had repeated meetings, and by their votes
declared the commissioners and their officers a
great grievance, and yesterday instructed their
representatives to endeavor that enquiry should
be made by the assembly whether any person
by writing or in any other way had encouraged
the sending troops here, there being some alarming
reports that troops are expected, but have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
not taken any measures to discountenance the
promoters of the late proceedings; but on the
contrary appointed one or more of the actors or
abettors on a committee appointed to wait on the
governor, and to desire him to order the man of
war out of the harbour.</p>

<p>Ignorant as they be, yet the heads of a Boston
town-meeting influence all public measures.</p>

<p>It is not possible this anarchy should last always.
Mr. Hallowell who will be the bearer
of this tells me he has the honour of being personally
known to you. I beg leave to refer you
to him for a more full account.</p>

<p>I am, with great esteem,</p>

<p class="signoff1">Sir, your most humble and obedient servant,</p>

<p class="name">THO. HUTCHINSON.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, August, 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">It is very necessary other information should
be had in England of the present state of the
commissioners of the customs than what common
fame will bring to you or what you will receive
from most of the letters which go from hence,
people in general being prejudiced by many false
reports and misrepresentations concerning them.
Seven eighths of the people of the country suppose
the board itself to be unconstitutional and
cannot be undeceived and brought to believe
that a board has existed in England all this century,
and that the board established here has no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
new powers given to it. Our incendiaries know
it but they industriously and very wickedly publish
the contrary. As much pains has been taken
to prejudice the country against the persons
of the commissioners and their characters have
been misrepresented and cruelly treated especially
since their confinement at the castle where
they are not so likely to hear what is said of
them and are not so able to confute it.</p>

<p>It is now pretended they need not to have
withdrawn, that Mr. Williams had stood his
ground without any injury although the mob beset
his house, &amp;c. There never was that spirit
raised against the under officers as against the
commissioners, <i>I mean four of them</i>. They had
a public affront offered them by the town of
Boston who refused to give the use of their hall
for a public dinner unless it was stipulated that
the commissioners should not be invited. An
affront of the same nature at the motion of Mr.
Hancock was offered by a company of cadets.
Soon after a vessel of Mr. Hancock’s being seized
the officers were mobb’d and the commissioners
were informed they were threatned. I own
I was in pain for them. I do not believe if the
mob had seized them, there was any authority
able and willing to have rescued them. After
they had withdrawn the town signified to the governor
by a message that it was expected or desired
they should not return. It was then the general
voice that it would not be safe for them to
return. After all this the sons of liberty say
they deserted or abdicated.</p>

<p>The other officers of the customs in general
either did not leave the town or soon returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
it. Some of them seem to be discontented with
the commissioners. Great pains have been taken
to increase the discontent. Their office by these
means is rendered extremely burdensome. Every
thing they do is found fault with, and yet
no particular illegality or even irregularity mentioned.
There is too much hauteur some of
their officers say in the treatment they receive.
They say they treat their officers as the commissioners
treat their officers in England and require
no greater deference. After all it is not
the persons but the office of the commissioners
which has raised this spirit, and the distinction
made between the commissioners is because it has
been given out that four of them were in favor
of the new establishment and the <i>fifth was
not</i>. If Mr. Hallowell arrived safe he can inform
you many circumstances relative to this distinction
which I very willingly excuse myself
from mentioning.</p>

<p>I know of no burden brought upon the fair
trader by the new establishment. The illicit
trader finds the risque greater than it used to be,
especially in the port where the board is constantly
held. Another circumstance which increases
the prejudice is this; the new duties happened
to take place just about the time the commissioners
arrived. People have absurdly connected
the duties and board of commissioners,
and suppose we should have had no additional
duties if there had been no board to have the
charge of collecting them. With all the aid you
can give to the officers of the crown they will
have enough to do to maintain the authority of
government and to carry the laws into execution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
If they are discountenanced, neglected or fail of
support from you, they must submit to every
thing the present opposers of government think
fit to require of them.</p>

<p>There is no office under greater discouragements
than that of the commissioners. Some of
my friends recommended me to the ministry. I
think myself very happy that I am not one. Indeed
it would have been incompatible with my
post as chief justice, and I must have declined it,
and I should do it although no greater salary had
been affixed to the chief justices place than the
small pittance allowed by the province.</p>

<p>From my acquaintance with the commissioners
I have conceived a personal esteem for them, but
my chief inducement to make this representation
to you is a regard to the public interest which
I am sure will suffer if the opposition carry their
point against them.</p>

<p>I am with very great esteem,</p>

<p class="signoff1">Sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="name">THO. HUTCHINSON.</p>

<p>August 10. Yesterday at a meeting of the
merchants it was agreed by all present to give
no more orders for goods from England, nor receive
any on commission until the late acts are
repealed. And it is said all except sixteen in the
town have subscribed an engagement of that tenor.
I hope the subscription will be printed
that I may transmit it to you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 4th October, 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I was absent upon one of our circuits when
Mr. Byles arrived. Since my return I have received
from him your obliging letter of 31st July.
I never dared to think what the resentment of
the nation would be upon Hallowell’s arrival.
It is not strange that measures should be immediately
taken to reduce the colonies to their
former state of government and order, but that
the national funds should be effected by it is to
me a little mysterious and surprizing. Principles
of government absurd enough, spread thro’
all the colonies; but I cannot think that in any
colony, people of any consideration have ever
been so mad as to think of a revolt. Many of
the common people have been in a frenzy, and
talk’d of dying in defence of their liberties, and
have spoke and printed what is highly criminal,
and too many of rank above the vulgar, and some
<i>in public posts</i> have countenanced and encouraged
them until they increased so much in their numbers
and in their opinion of their importance as
to submit to government no further than they
thought proper. The legislative powers have
been influenced by them, and the executive
powers intirely lost their force. There has
been continual danger of mobs and insurrections,
but they would have spent all their force within
ourselves, the officers of the Crown and some
of the few friends who dared to stand by them
possibly might have been knock’d in the head,
and some such fatal event would probably have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
brought the people to their senses. For four or
five weeks past the distemper has been growing,
and I confess I have not been without some
apprehensions for myself, but my friends have
had more for me, and I have had repeated and
frequent notices from them from different quarters,
<i>one of the last I will inclose to you</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In
this state of things there was no security but
quitting my posts, which nothing but the last
extremity would justify. As chief justice for
two years after our first disorders I kept the
grand juries tolerably well to their duty. The
last spring there had been several riots, and a
most infamous libel had been published in one of
the papers, which I enlarged upon, and the
grand jury had determined to make presentments,
but the attorney-general not attending them the
first day, Otis and his creatures who were alarmed
and frightned exerted themselves the next
day and prevailed upon so many of the jury to
change their voices, that there was not a sufficient
number left to find a bill. They have been ever
since more enraged against me than ever. At the
desire of the governor I committed to writing
the charge while it lay in my memory, and as I
have no further use for it I will inclose it as it
may give you some idea of our judicatories.</p>

<p>Whilst we were in this state, news came of two
regiments being ordered from Halifax, and soon
after two more from Ireland. The minds of
people were more and more agitated, broad hints
were given that the troops should never land, a
barrel of tar was placed upon the beacon, in the
night to be fired to bring in the country when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
troops appeared, and all the authority of the
government was not strong enough to remove it.
The town of Boston met and passed a number
of weak but very criminal votes; and as the governor
declined calling an assembly they sent
circular letters to all the towns and districts to
send a person each that there might be a general
consultation at so extraordinary a crisis. They
met and spent a week, made themselves ridiculous,
and then dissolv’d themselves, after a message
or two to the governor which he refused to
receive; a petition to the King which I dare say
<i>their agent</i> will never be allow’d to present, and
a result which they have published ill-natured
and impotent.</p>

<p>In this confusion the troops from Halifax arrived.
I never was much afraid of the people’s
taking arms, but I was apprehensive of violence
from the mob, it being their last chance before
the troops could land. As the prospect of revenge
became more certain their courage abated
in proportion. Two regiments are landed, but
a new grievance is now rais’d. The troops are
by act of parliament to be quartered no where
else but in the barracks until they are full.
There are barracks enough at the castle to hold
both regiments. It is therefore against the act to
bring any of them into town. This was started
by the council in their answer to the governor,
which to make themselves popular, they in an
unprecedented way published and have alarmed
all the province; for although none but the most
contracted minds could put such a construction
upon the act, yet after this declaration of the
council nine tenths of the people suppose it just.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
I wish the act had been better express’d, but it
is absurd to suppose the parliament intended to
take from the King the direction of his forces by
confining them to a place where any of the colonies
might think fit to build barracks. It is
besides ungrateful, for it is known to many that
this provision was brought into the bill after it
had been framed without it, from mere favor to
the colonies. I hear the commander in chief has
provided barracks or quarters, but a doubt still
remains with some of the council, whether they
are to furnish the articles required, unless the
men are in the province barracks, and they are
to determine upon it to day.</p>

<p>The government has been so long in the
hands of the populace that it must come out of
them by degrees, at least it will be a work of
time to bring the people back to just notions of
the nature of government.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepperrell a young gentleman of good
character, and grandson and principal heir to the
late Sir William Pepperrell being bound to London,
I shall deliver this letter to him, as it will
be too bulky for postage, and desire him to wait
upon you with it.</p>

Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">The great esteem I have for you in every
point of light, perhaps renders my fears
and doubts for the safety of your person greater
than they ought to be; however if that is an error
it certainly results from true friendship, naturally
jealous. Last night I was informed by a gentleman
of my acquaintance, who had his information
from one intimate with and knowing to the
infernal purposes of the sons of liberty as they
falsely stile themselves, that he verily believ’d,
from the terrible threats and menaces by those
catalines against you, that your life is greatly in
danger. This informant I know is under obligations
to you and is a man of veracity. He
express’d himself with concern for you, and the
gentleman acquainting me with this horrid circumstance,
assured me he was very uneasy till
you had notice. I should have done myself the
honor of waiting on you but am necessarily prevented.
The duty I owed to you as a friend
and to the public as a member of society, would
not suffer me to rest till I had put your honor
upon your guard; for tho’ this may be a false
alarm, nothing would have given me greater
pain, if any accident had happen’d, and I had
been silent. If possible I will see you to morrow,
and let you know further into this black
affair.</p>

<p class="signoff1">And am with the sincerest friendship
and respect, your honors most obedient,
and most humble servant,</p>

<p class="name">ROB. AUCHMUTY.</p>

<p class="noindent">To the hon’ble Thomas Hutchinson,
Sept. 14, 1768.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 10th December, 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear">Dear Sir,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am just now informed that a number of the
council, perhaps 8 or 10, who live in and near
this town, have met together and agreed upon a
long address or petition to parliament, and that it
will be sent by this ship to Mr. Bollan to be presented.
Mr. Danforth who is president of the
council told the governor upon enquiry, that it
was sent to him to sign, and he supposed the rest
of the council who had met together would sign
after him in order, but he had since found that
they had wrote over his name <i>by order of council</i>,
which makes it appear to be an act of council.
This may be a low piece of cunning in him, but
be it as it may, it’s proper it should be known that
the whole is no more than the doings of a part of
the council only, although even that is not very
material, since, if they had all been present without
the governor’s summons the meeting would
have been irregular and unconstitutional, and
ought to be discountenanced and censured. I
suppose there is no instance of the privy council’s
meeting and doing business without the king’s
presence or special direction, except in committees
upon such business as by his majesty’s order
has been referr’d to them by an act of council,
and I have known no instance here without the
governor until within three or four months past.</p>

<p>I thought it very necessary the circumstances
of this proceeding should be known, tho’ if there
be no necessity for it, I think it would be best it
should not be known that the intelligence comes
from me.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I am with very great regard, Sir,</p>

<p class="signoff2">your most humble and most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="name">THO. HUTCHINSON.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 20th January, 1769.</i></p>

<p class="dear"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">You have laid me under very great obligations
by the very clear and full account of
proceedings in parliament, which I received from
you by Capt. Scott. You have also done much
service to the people of the province. For a
day or two after the ship arrived, the enemies of
government gave out that their friends in parliament
were increasing, and all things would be
soon on the old footing; in other words that all
acts imposing duties would be repealed, the commissioners
board dissolved, the customs put on the
old footing, and <i>illicit</i> trade be carried on with
little or no hazard. It was very fortunate that
I had it in my power to prevent such a false representation
from spreading through the province.
I have been very cautious of using your name,
but I have been very free in publishing abroad
the substance of your letter, and declaring that
I had my intelligence from the best authority,
and have in a great measure defeated the ill design
in raising and attempting to spread so groundless
a report. What marks of resentment the
parliament will show, whether they will be upon
the province in general or particular persons,
is extremely uncertain, but that they will be placed
somewhere is most certain, and I add, because
<i>I think it ought to be so</i>, that those who have
been most steady in preserving the constitution
and opposing the licenciousness of such as call
themselves sons of liberty wi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>ll certainly meet
with favor and encouragement.</p>

<p>This is most certainly a crisis. I really wish
that there may not have been the least degree
of severity beyond what is absolutely necessary
to maintain, I think I may say to you the <i>dependance</i>
which a colony ought to have upon the parent
state; but if no measures shall have been
taken to secure this dependance, or nothing more
than some declaratory acts or resolves, <i>it is all
over with us</i>. The friends of government will
be utterly disheartned and the friends of anarchy
will be afraid of nothing be it ever so extravagant.</p>

<p>The last vessel from London had a quick passage.
We expect to be in suspense for the three
or four next weeks and then to hear our fate. I
never think of the measures necessary for the
peace and good order of the colonies without
pain. There must be an abridgment of what
are called English liberties. I relieve myself by
considering that in a remove from the state of
nature to the most perfect state of government
there must be a great restraint of natural liberty.
I doubt whether it is possible to project a system
of government in which a colony 3000 miles
distant from the parent state shall enjoy all the
liberty of the parent state. I am certain I have
never yet seen the projection. I wish the good
of the colony when I wish to see some further
restraint of liberty rather than the connexion
with the parent state should be broken; for I am
sure such a breach must prove the ruin of the
colony. Pardon me this excursion, it really proceeds
from the state of mind into which our perplexed
affairs often throws me.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I have the honor to be with very great esteem,
Sir, your most humble and most obedient servant,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<p class="name">THO. HUTCHINSON.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 20th October, 1769.</i></p>

<p class="dear"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I thank you for your last favor of July
18th. I fancy in my last to you about two
months ago I have answered the greatest part of it.</p>

<p>My opinion upon the combination of the merchants,
I gave you very fully. How long they
will be able to continue them if parliament
should not interpose is uncertain. In most articles
they may another year, and you run the
risque of their substituting when they are put to
their shifts something of their own in the place
of what they used to have from you, and which
they will never return to you for. But it is not
possible that provision for dissolving these combinations
and subjecting all who do not renounce
them to penalties adequate to the offence should
not be made the first week the parliament meets.
Certainly all parties will unite in so extraordinary
case if they never do in any other. So much
has been said upon the repeal of the duties laid
by the last act, that it will render it very difficult
to keep people’s minds quiet if that should be
refused them. They deserve punishment you
will say, but laying or continuing taxes upon all
cannot be thought equal, seeing many will be
punished who are not offenders. <i>Penalties of
another kind seem better adapted.</i></p>

<p>I have been tolerably treated since the governor’s
departure, no other charge being made
against me in our scandalous news-papers except
my bad principles in matters of government, and
this charge has had little <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>effect, and a great many
friends promise me support.</p>

<p>I must beg the favor of you to keep secret
every thing I write, until we are in a more settled
state, for the party here either by their
<i>agent</i> or by some of their emissaries in London,
have sent them every report or rumor of the
contents of letters wrote from hence. I hope
we shall see better times both here and in England.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I am with great esteem,</p>

<p class="name">THO. HUTCHINSON.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 7th May, 1767.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am indebted to you for the obliging manner
in which you receiv’d my recommendation
of my good friend Mr. Paxton, as well as for the
account you are pleased to send me of the situation
of affairs in the mother country.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that the colonies give you
so much employment, and it is impossible to say
how long it will be before things settle into quiet
among us. We have some here who have been
so busy in fomenting the late disturbances, that
they may now think it needful for their own security
to keep up the spirit. They have plumed
themselves much upon the victory they have
gained, and the support they have since met with;
nor could any thing better shew what they would
still be at, than the manner in which by their own
account published in the news-papers last August
they celebrated the 14th of that month, as t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>he
first anniversary commemoration of what they
had done at the tree of liberty on that day the
year before. Here a number of respectable
gentlemen as they inform us now met, and
among other toasts drank general Paoli, and the
spark of liberty kindled in Spain. I am now
speaking of a few individuals only, the body of
the people are well disposed, yet when you come
to see the journal of the house of representatives
the last session, I fear you will think that the
same spirit has seized our public counsels. I can
however fairly say thus much in behalf of the
government, that the last house was packed by
means of a public proscription just before the
election, of the greatest part of those who had
appeared in the preceding session in the support
of government: their names were published in
an inflammatory news-paper, and their constituents
made to believe they were about to sell them
for slaves. Writs are now out for a new assembly,
but I cannot answer for the choice: I hope
however that the people in general are in a better
temper; yet the moderate men have been so
browbeaten in the house, and found themselves
so insignificant there the last year, that some of
them will voluntary decline coming again. I
think this looks too much like a despair of the
common-wealth, and cannot be justified on patriotic
principles.</p>

<p>The election of counsellors was carried the
last year as might have been expected from such
an house. The officers of the crown and the
judges of the superior court were excluded. And
I hear that it is the design of some who expect
to be returned members of the house this year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
make sure work at the ensuing election of counsellors,
by excluding, if they can, the gentlemen
of the council (who by charter remain such ’till
others are chosen in their room) from any share
in the choice, tho’ they have always had their
voice in it hitherto from the first arrival of the
charter. If the house do this, they will have
it in their power to model the council as they
please, and throw all the powers of government
into the hands of the people, unless the governor
should again exert his negative as he did the last
year.</p>

<p>You have doubtless seen some of the curious
messages from the late house to the governor, and
can’t but have observed with how little decency
they have attacked both the governor and the
lieutenant governor. They have also in effect
forced the council to declare themselves parties
in the quarrel they had against the latter in a
matter of mere indifference. In their message
to the governor of the 31st of January they
have explicitly charged the lieutenant governor
(a gentleman to whom they are more indebted
than to any one man in the government) with
“ambition and lust of power”, merely for paying
a compliment to the governor agreeable to
ancient usage, by attending him to court and
being present in the council-chamber when he
made his speech at the opening of the session;
at which time they go on to say, “none but the
general court and their servants are intended to
be present”, still holding out to the people the
servants of the crown as objects of insignificance,
ranking the secretary with their door-keeper, as
servants of the assembly; for the secretary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> with
his clerks and the door-keeper are the only
persons present with the assembly on these
occasions.</p>

<p>The officers of the crown being thus lessen’d
in the eyes of the people, takes off their weight
and influence, and the balance will of course
turn in favor of the people, and what makes
them still more insignificant is their dependance
on the people for a necessary support: If something
were left to the goodwill of the people,
yet nature should be sure of a support. The
governor’s salary has for about 35 years past
been pretty well understood to be a thousand
pound a year sterling. When this sum was first
agreed to, it was very well; but an increase of
wealth since has brought along with it an increase
of luxury, so that what was sufficient to keep up
a proper distinction and support the dignity of a
governor then, may well be supposed to be insufficient
for the purpose now. The lieutenant
governor has no appointments as such: the captaincy
of Castle-William which may be worth
£.120 sterling a year is looked upon indeed as
an appendage to his commission, and the late lieutenant
governor enjoyed no other appointment:
he lived a retired life upon his own estate in the
country, and was easy. The present lieutenant
governor indeed has other appointments, but the
people are quarrelling with him for it, and will
not suffer him to be easy unless he will retire also.</p>

<p>The secretary may have something more than
£.200 a year sterling, but has for the two last
years been allowed £.60 lawful money a year
less than had been usual for divers years preceding,
tho’ he had convinced the house by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
committee that without this deduction he would
have had no more than £.250 sterling per annum
in fees, perquisites and salary altogether, which
is not the one half of his annual expence.</p>

<p>The crown did by charter reserve to itself the
appointment of a governor, lieutenant governor
and secretary: the design of this was without
doubt to maintain some kind of balance between
the powers of the crown and of the people; but
if officers are not in some measure independent
of the people (for it is difficult to serve two masters)
they will sometimes have a hard struggle
between duty to the crown and a regard to self,
which must be a very disagreeable situation to
them, as well as a weakening to the authority of
government. The officers of the crown are very
few and are therefore the more easily provided
for without burdening the people: <i>and such provision
I look upon as necessary to the restoration
and support of the King’s authority</i>.</p>

<p>But it may be said how can any new measures
be taken without raising new disturbances? The
manufacturers in England will rise again and defeat
the measures of government. This game
’tis true has been played once and succeeded, and
it has been asserted here, that it is in the power
of the colonies at any time to raise a rebellion
in England by refusing to fend for their manufactures.
For my own part I do not believe this.
The merchants in England, and I don’t know
but those in London and Bristol only, might always
govern in this matter and quiet the manufacturer.
The merchant’s view is always to his
own interest. As the trade is now managed, the
dealer here sends to the merchant in England for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
his goods; upon these goods the English merchant
puts a profit of 10 or more probably of 15
per cent when he sends them to his employer in
America. The merchant is so jealous of foregoing
this profit, that an American trader cannot
well purchase the goods he wants of the manufacturer;
for should the merchant know that the
manufacturer had supplied an American, he would
take off no more of his wares. The merchants
therefore having this profit in view will by one
means or other secure it. They know the goods
which the American market demands, and may
therefore safely take them off from the manufacturer,
tho’ they should have no orders for
shipping them this year or perhaps the next; and
I dare say, it would not be longer before the
Americans would clamour for a supply of goods
from England, for it is vain to think they can
supply themselves. The merchant might then
put an advanced price upon his goods, and possibly
be able to make his own terms; or if it should
be thought the goods would not bear an advanced
price to indemnify him, it might be worth while
for the government to agree with the merchants
before hand to allow them a premium equivalent
to the advance of their stock, and <i>then the game
would be over</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have wrote with freedom in confidence of
my name’s not being used on the occasion. For
though I have wrote nothing but what in my
conscience I think an American may upon just
principles advance, and what a servant of the
crown ought upon all proper occasions to suggest,
yet the many prejudices I have to combat with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
may render it unfit it should be made public.</p>

<p>I communicated to governor Bernard what
you mentioned concerning him, who desires me
to present you his compliments, and let you
know that he is obliged to you for the expressions
of your regard for his injured character.</p>

<p class="hanging">I ask your acceptance of a journal
of the last session which is put

</div>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 11 May, 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am this moment favored with your very obliging
letter by Capt. Jarvis of the 2d March,
which I have but just time to acknowledge, as
this is the day given out for the ship to sail. I
wrote you the 23d of February in reply to your
letter of the 28th December, that of the 12th
February which you refer to in this of the 2d of
March is not yet come to hand. You lay me,
sir, under the greatest obligations as well for the
interesting account of public affairs which you are
from time to time pleased to transmit me, as for
your steady attention to my private concerns. I
shall always have the most grateful sense of Mr.
Grenville’s intentions of favor also, whether I
ever reap any benefit from them or not. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
a proper support afforded to the king’s officers,
the respect due to government will of course
fail; yet I cannot say whether under the present
circumstances, and considering the temper the
people are now in, an additional provision for me
would be of real benefit to me personally or not.
It has been given out that no person who receives
a stipend from the government at home, shall
live in the country. Government here wants
some <i>effectual</i> support: No sooner was it known
that the lieut. governor had a provision of £.200
a year made for him out of the revenue, than he
was advised in the Boston Gazette to resign all
pretensions to a seat in council, either with or
without a voice. The temper of the people
may be surely learnt from that infamous paper;
it is the very thing that forms their temper; for
if they are not in the temper of the writer at the
time of the publication, yet it is looked upon as
the ORACLE, and they soon bring their temper
to it. Some of the latest of them are very expressive,
I will not trouble you with sending them,
as I imagine they somehow or other find their
way to you: But I cannot but apprehend from
these papers and from hints that are thrown out,
that if the petition of the House to his Majesty
and their letters to divers noble Lords should
fail of success, some people will be mad enough
to go to extremities. The commissioners of the
customs have already been openly affronted,
the governor’s company of Cadets have come to
a resolution not to wait on him (as usual) on the
day of General Election the 25th instant if
those gentlemen are of the company. And the
Town of Boston have passed a Vote that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Faneuil-Hall
(in which the governor and his company
usually dine on that day) shall not be opened to
him if the commissioners are invited to dine with
him. A list of counsellors has within a few
days past been printed and dispersed by way of
sneer on Lord Shelburne’s letter, made up of
king’s officers; which list, the writer says, if
adopted at the next general election may take
away all grounds of complaint, and may possibly
prove a healing and very salutary measure. The
lieutenant governor is at the head of this list, they
have done me the honor to put me next, the
commissioners of the customs are all in the list
except <i>Mr. Temple</i>, and to compleat the list,
they have added some of the waiters. I never
thought ’till very lately that they acted upon any
<i>settled plan</i>, nor do I now think they have ’till
of late; a few, a very few, among us have
planned the present measures, and the government
has been too weak to subdue their turbulent
spirits. Our situation is not rightly known;
but it is a matter worthy of the most serious attention.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I am with the greatest respect,</p>

<p class="signoff2">Sir, your most obedient and</p>

<p class="signoff3">most humble Servant,</p>

<p class="name">AND<sup>W</sup>. OLIVER.</p>

<div class="half">
<p class="hanging">I shall take proper care to forward

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>Boston, 13th February, 1769.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I have your very obliging favor of the 4th
of October. I find myself constrained as
well by this letter as by my son and daughter
Spooner’s letters since, to render you my
most sincere thanks for the very polite notice you
have taken of them; and I pray my most respectful
compliments to the good lady your mother,
whose friendly reception of them at Nonsuch
has, I find engaged the warmest esteem
and respect&mdash;He hath wrote us that he had a
prospect of succeeding in the business he went
upon; but the last letter we had was from her
of the 23d of November, acquainting us that he
had been very ill, but was getting better. She
writes as a person overcome with a sense of the
kindness they had met with, in a place where
they were strangers, on this trying occasion.</p>

<p>You have heard of the arrival of the King’s
troops, the quiet reception they met with among
us was not at all surprizing to me.&mdash;I am sorry
there was any occasion for sending them. From
the address of the gentlemen of the council to
General Gage, it might be supposed there was
none. I have seen a letter from our friend Ingersoll
with this paraphrase upon it&mdash;“We hope
that your Excellency observing with your own
eyes <i>now</i> the troops are among us, our peaceable
and quiet behaviour, will be convinced that
that wicked G&mdash;&mdash;r B&mdash;&mdash;d told <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a fib in saying,
We were not so before they came.”</p>

<p>I have given you the sense of a stranger on a
single paragraph of this address, because I suspected
my own opinion of it, ’till I found it thus
confirm’d&mdash;If you have the news-papers containing
the address, your own good sense will lead
you to make some other remarks upon it, as well
as to trace the influence under which it seems to
have been penned. The disturbers of our peace
take great advantage of such aids from people in
office and power&mdash;The lieutenant governor has
communicated to me your letter containing an
account of the debates in parliament on the first
day of the session: We soon expect their decision
on American affairs, some I doubt not with fear and
trembling&mdash;Yet I have very lately had occasion
to know, that be the determination of parliament
what it will, it is the determination of some to
agree to no terms that shall remove us from our
old foundation. This confirms me in an opinion
that I have taken up a long time since, that if
there be no way to take off the original incendiaries,
they will continue to instill their poison into
the minds of the people through the vehicle
of the BOSTON GAZETTE.</p>

<p>In your letter to the lieutenant governor you
observe upon two defects in our constitution, the
popular election of the Council, and the return
of Juries by the Towns. The first of these arises
from the Charter itself; the latter from our
provincial Laws. The method of appointing our
Grand Juries lies open to management. Whoever
pleases, nominates them at our town-meetings;
by this means one who was suppos’d to be
a principal in the Riots of the 10th of June last,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was upon that Jury whose business it was to inquire
into them: But the provincial legislature
hath made sufficient provision for the return of
Petit Juries by their act of 23d Geo. 2d, which
requires the several towns to take lists of all persons
liable by law to serve, and forming them into
two classes, put their names written on separate
papers into two different boxes, one for the superior
court and the other for the inferior: And
when veniries are issued, the number therein required
are to be drawn out in open town-meeting,
no person to serve oftner than once in three
years&mdash;The method of appointing Grand Juries
appears indeed defective; but if the other is not
it may be imputed to the times rather than to the
defect of the laws&mdash;that neither the Grand Juries
nor the Petit Juries have of late answered the
expectations of government.</p>

<p>As to the appointment of the council, I am
of opinion that neither the popular elections in
this province, nor their appointment in what are
called the royal governments by the King’s mandamus,
are free from exceptions, especially if the
council as a legislative body is intended to answer
the idea of the house of lords in the British legislature.
There they are suppos’d to be a free
and independent body, and on their being such
the strength and firmness of the constitution does
very much depend: whereas the election or appointment
of the councils in the manner before
mentioned renders them altogether dependent on
their constituents. The King is the fountain of
honour, and as such the peers of the realm derive
their honours from him; but then they hold
them by a surer tenure than the p<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>rovincial counsellors
who are appointed by mandamus. On
the other hand, our popular elections very often
expose them to contempt; for nothing is more
common, than for the representatives, when they
find the council a little untractable at the close
of the year, to remind them that May is at hand.</p>

<p>It may be accounted by the colonies as dangerous
to admit of any alterations in their charters,
as it is by the governors in the church to make
any in the establishment; yet to make the resemblance
as near as may be to the British parliament,
some alteration is necessary.</p>

<p>It is not requisite that I know of, that a
counsellor shou’d be a freeholder; his residence
according to the charier is a sufficient qualification;
for that provides only, that he be an inhabitant
of or proprietor of lands within the district
for which he is chosen: whereas the peers of
the realm fit in the house of lords, as I take it,
in virtue of their baronies. If there should be a
reform of any of the colony charters with a view
to keep up the resemblance of the three estates
in England, the legislative council shou’d consist
of men of landed estates; but as our landed
estates here are small at present, the yearly value
of £.100 sterling per annum might in some of
them at least be a sufficient qualification. As our
estates are partable after the decease of the proprietor,
the honour could not be continued in
families as in England: It might however be continued
in the appointee <i>quam diu bene se gesserit</i>,
and proof be required of some mal-practice before
a suspension or removal. Bankruptcy also
might be another ground for removal. A small
legislative council might answer the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>s of
government; but it might tend to weaken that
levelling principle, which is cherish’d by the present
popular constitution, to have an honorary
order establish’d, out of which the council shou’d
be appointed. There is no way now to put a
man of fortune above the common level, and
exempt him from being chosen by the people
into the lower offices, but his being appointed a
justice of the peace; this is frequently done when
there is no kind of expectation of his undertaking
the trust, and has its inconveniences. For
remedy hereof it might be expedient to have an
order of Patricians or Esquires instituted, to be
all men of fortune or good landed estates, and
appointed by the governor with the advice of
council, and enroll’d in the secretary’s office,
who shou’d be exempted from the lower offices
in government as the justices now are; and to
have the legislative council (<i>which in the first
instance might be nominated by the Crown</i>) from
time to time fill’d up, as vacancies happen out of
this order of men, who, if the order consisted
only of men of landed estates, might elect, as
the Scottish peers do, only reserving to the King’s
governor a negative on such choice. The King
in this case wou’d be still acknowledged as the
fountain of honour, as having in the first instance
the appointment of the persons enroll’d, out of
whom the council are to be chosen, and finally
having a negative on the choice. Or, the King
might have the immediate appointment by mandamus
as at present in the royal governments.
As the gentlemen of the council would rank
above the body from which they are taken, they
might bear a title one degree above that of esqui<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>re.
Besides this legislative council, a privy council
might be establish’d, to consist of some or all of
those persons who constitute the legislative council,
and of other persons members of the house of
representatives or otherwise of note or distinction;
which wou’d extend the honours of government,
and afford opportunity of distinguishing men of
character and reputation, the expectation of which
wou’d make government more respectable.</p>

<p>I wou’d not trouble you with these reveries
of mine, were I not assured of your readiness
to forgive the communication, although you
could apply it to no good purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. Spooner sent me a pamphlet under a blank
cover, intituled, “<i>the state of the nation</i>”. I run
over it by myself before I had heard any one
mention it, and tho’t I cou’d evidently mark the
sentiments of some of my friends. By what I
have since heard and seen, it looks as if I was
not mistaken. Your right honorable friend I
trust will not be offended if I call him mine&mdash;I
am sure you will not when I term you such&mdash;I
have settled it for a long time in my own mind
that without a representation in the supreme legislature,
there cannot be that union between the
head and the members as to produce a healthful
constitution of the whole body. I have doubted
whether this union could be perfected by the
first experiment. The plan here exhibited seems
to be formed in generous and moderate principles,
and bids the fairest of any I have yet seen
to be adopted. Such a great design may as in
painting require frequent touching before it becomes
a piece highly finish’d; and after all may
require the miliorating hand of time to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
please universally. Thus the British constitution
consider’d as without the colonies attain’d
its glory. The book I had sent me is in such
request, that I have not been able to keep it
long enough by me, to consider it in all its parts.
I wish to hear how it is receiv’d in the house of
commons. I find by the publications both of
governor Pownall and Mr. Bollan, that they each
of them adopt the idea of an union and representation,
and I think it must more and more
prevail. The argument against it from local inconveniency,
must as it appears to me be more
than balanc’d by greater inconveniencies on the
other side the question, the great difficulty will
be in the terms of union.&mdash;I add no more, as I
fear I have already trespass’d much on your
time and patience, but that I am,</p>

<p class="signoff1">Sir, your obliged and most</p>

<p class="signoff2">obedient humble Servant,</p>

<p class="name">AND<sup>W</sup>. OLIVER.</p>

<hr class="full" />

<p class="date"><i>New-York, 12th August, 1769.</i></p>

<p class="dear">SIR,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I have been in this city for some time past
executing (with others) his Majesty’s commission
for settling the boundary between this
province and that of New-Jersey. I left Boston
the 11th July, since which my advices from
London have come to me very imperfect; but
as my friend Mr. Thompson writes me that he
had drawn up my case and with your approbati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>on
laid it before the D. of Grafton, I think it
needful once more to mention this business to
you.</p>

<p>There was a time when I thought the authority
of government might have been easily restored;
but while it’s friends and the officers of
the crown are left to an abject dependance on
these very people who are <i>undermining it’s authority</i>;
and while these are suffered not only to
go unpunished, but on the contrary meet with all
kind of support and encouragement, it cannot
be expected that you will ever again recover that
respect which the colonies had been wont to pay
the parent state. Government at home will
deceive itself, if it imagines that the taking off
the duty on glass, paper and painter’s colors will
work a reconciliation, and nothing more than this,
as I can learn, is proposed in Ld. H’s late circular
letter. It is the principle that is now disputed;
the combination against importation extends
to tea, although it comes cheaper than ever,
as well as to the other forementioned articles.
In Virginia it is extended lately to wines; and I
have heard one of the first leaders in these measures
in Boston say, that we should never be
upon a proper footing ’till all the revenue acts
from the 15th Charles 2d were repealed. Our
assembly in the Massachusetts may have been
more illiberal than others in their public messages
and resolves; yet we have some people among
us still who dare to speak in favor of government:
But here I do not find so much as one, unless it
be some of the King’s servants; and yet my business
here leads me to associate with the best.
They universally approve of the combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
against importing of goods from Great-Britain,
unless the revenue acts are repealed, which appears
to me little less than assuming a negative on
all acts of parliament which they do not like!
They say expresly, we are bound by none made
since our emigration, but such as for our own
convenience we choose to submit to; such for
instance as that for establishing a post-office.
The Bill of Rights and the Habeas Corpus Acts,
they say are only declaratory of the common
law which we brought with us.</p>

<hr />

<p>Under such circumstance as these, why should
I wish to expose myself to popular resentment?
Were I to receive any thing out of the revenue,
I must expect to be abused for it. Nor do I
find that our chief justice has received the £.200
granted him for that service; and yet the assembly
have this year withheld his usual grant, most
probably because he has such a warrant from the
crown.</p>

<hr />

<p>With regard to my negotiations with Mr. Rogers,
I did in conformity to your opinion make
an apology to Mr. Secretary Pownall for mentioning
it, and there submitted it. I hear it has
been since talk’d of; but unless I could be assured
in one shape or other of £.300 per annum,
with the other office, I would not chuse to quit
what I have. I have no ambition to be distinguished,
if I am only to be held up as a mark
of popular envy or resentment. I was in hopes
before now through the intervention of your
good offices to have received some mark of favor
from your good friend; but the time is not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
come to expect it through that channel! I will
however rely on your friendship, whenever you
can with propriety appear in forwarding my interest,
or preventing any thing that may prove
injurious to it.</p>

<hr />

<p>If Mr. R. has interest enough to obtain the
secretary’s place, I shall upon receiving proper
security think myself in honor bound to second
his views, though I have none at present from
him but a conditional note he formerly wrote me.
If he is not like to succeed, and my son Daniel
could have my place, I would be content unless
affairs take a different turn to resign in his favor,
whether administration should think proper to
make any further provision for me or not. And
yet I never thought of withdrawing myself from
the service, while there appeared to me any prospect
of my being able to promote it.</p>

<hr />

<p>If I have wrote with freedom, I consider I
am writing to a friend, and that I am perfectly
safe in opening myself to you.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I am, with great respect,</p>

<p class="signoff2">Sir, your most obedient,</p>

<p class="signoff3">humble servant.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The commissioners of the customs have met
with every insult since their arrival at
Boston, and at last have been obliged to seek protection

Hallowell, the comptroller of the customs
who will have the honor to deliver you this Letter,
will inform you of many particulars; he is
sent by the Board with their letters to Government.
Unless we have immediately two or three

<p class="date"><i>Boston, Decem. 12th 1768.</i></p>

<p class="dear"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="dropcap">I wrote you a few days ago, and did not then
think of troubling you upon any private
affair of mine, at least not so suddenly; but
within this day or two, I have had a conversation
with Mr. Oliver, secretary of the province, the
design of which was my succeeding to the post
he holds from the crown, upon the idea, that
provision would be made for governor Bernard,
and the lieutenant governor would succeed to
the chair, then the secretary is desirous of being
lieutenant governor, and if in any way, three
hundred pounds a year could be annexed to the
appointment. You are sensible the appointment
is in one department, and the grant of money
in another; now the present lieutenant governor
has an assignment of £.200 a year upon the
customs here; he has not received any thing
from it as yet, and is doubtful if he shall; he
has no doubt of its lapse to the crown, if he has
the chair; if then by any interest that sum
could be assigned to Mr. Oliver as lieutenant
governor, and if he should be allowed (as has
been usual for all lieutenant governors) to hold
the command of the castle, that would be another
£.100. This would compleat the secretary’s
views; and he thinks his public services, the
injuries he has received in that service, and the
favorable sentiments entertained of him by government,
may lead him to these views, and he
hopes for the interest of his friends. The place
of secretary is worth £.300 a year, but is a
provincial grant at present, so that it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> not
allow to be quartered on: And as I had view
upon the place when I was in England, and
went so far as to converse with several men of
interest upon it, tho’ I never had an opportunity
to mention it to you after I recovered my
illness&mdash;I hope you will allow me your influence,
and by extending it at the treasury, to
facilitate the assignment of the £.200 a year, it
will be serving the secretary, and it will very
much oblige me.&mdash;&mdash;The secretary is
advanced in life, tho’ much more so in health,
which has been much impaired by the injuries
he received, and he wishes to quit the more active
scenes; he considers this as a kind of <i>otium cum
dignitate</i>, and from merits one may think he has
a claim to it. I will mention to you the gentlemen,
who are acquainted with my views and
whose favourable approbation I have had. Governor
Pownall, Mr. John Pownall, and Dr.
Franklin.&mdash;My lord Hillsborough is not unacquainted
with it&mdash;I have since I have been here,
wrote Mr. Jackson upon the subject, and have
by this vessel wrote Mr. Mauduit. I think my
character stands fair&mdash;I have not been without
application to public affairs, and have acquired
some knowledge of our provincial affairs, and notwithstanding
our many free conversations in England,
I am considered here as on government
side, for which I have been often traduced both
publickly and privately, and very lately have had
two or three slaps. The governor and lieutenant
governor are fully acquainted with the negociation
and I meet their approbation; all is upon
the idea the governor is provided for, and there
shall by any means be a vacancy of the lieut. go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>vernor’s
place. I have gone so far, as to say to
some of my friends, that rather than not succeed
I would agree to pay the secretary £.100 a year
out of the office to make up £.300, provided he
could obtain only the assignment of £.200&mdash;but
the other proposal would to be sure be most eligible.
I scarce know any apology to make for
troubling you upon the subject; the friendship
you shewed me in London, and the favourable
expressions you made use of to the lieut. governor
in my behalf encourage me, besides a sort of
egotism, which inclines men to think what they
wish to be real. I submit myself to the enquiries
of any of my countrymen in England, but I
should wish the matter may be secret ’till it is
effected.</p>

<p class="signoff1">I am with very great respect and regard, my
dear sir,</p>

<p class="signoff2">Your most obedient, and
most humble servant,</p>

<p class="name">NATH. ROGERS.</p>
